  "introduction": "Choosing the right bento box can be overwhelming, especially with the 2026 school year approaching. In Australia, we see a massive spike in searches for <strong>\"kids lunch box steel\"</strong> starting in May and peaking through <strong>August and September</strong>. This guide helps you navigate the best in durable, non-toxic, and leak-proof technology to ensure your family's meals stay fresh and eco-friendly.",

      "content": "We know, the upfront cost of a stainless steel lunch box can feel like a bit of a pinch. But trust us, it’s one of the smartest investments you can make for the school years. High-quality food-grade steel is naturally non-porous, which is just a fancy way of saying it won’t hold onto smells or leach nasties like BPA into your little one's lunch. Plus, unlike plastic tubs that often need replacing every few terms (we’ve all been there!), a quality steel bento is built to last for years. It’s better for the planet and, in the long run, much better for your wallet too.",

      "a": "It’s usually a toss-up between <strong>ecoCocoon</strong> and <strong>Yumbox</strong>. Mums and dads love <strong>ecoCocoon</strong> for its incredible durability—it really stands the test of time. If you need something absolutely leak-proof for wet foods, the <strong>Yumbox Presto</strong> is often the go-to choice."
    },
    {
      "q": "Are Yumbox stainless steel lunchboxes leak-proof?",
      "a": "Yes! Parents rave about the specialised silicone seal. It’s fantastic for keeping wet foods like dips and yoghurt contained in their compartments, so you don’t end up with a soggy mess."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can a toddler open these lunchboxes independently?",
      "a": "Generally, yes. The <strong>Yumbox</strong> is particularly good for this, with an ergonomic latch that’s designed to be easy for small hands to pop open without help."

      "q": "Which lunchbox is easiest to wash?",
      "a": "<strong>Yumbox</strong> tends to win points here. It’s super quick to rinse and hand-wash, making the evening clean-up routine just that little bit easier."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do I need extra accessories for wet foods like yoghurt?",
      "a": "For most stainless steel boxes that aren't specifically sealed (like the ecoCocoon), we definitely recommend popping in a <strong>silicone cup</strong>. It keeps wet foods separate from dry crackers and sandwiches."
